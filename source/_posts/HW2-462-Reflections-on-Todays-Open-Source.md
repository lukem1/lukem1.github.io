## Reflections

For this post I am going to discuss two articles I read recently on [opensource.com](https://opensource.com).
The two articles don't have much in common save for their focus on open source, so I will discuss them individually in this post.

### How a local government migrated to open source

The first article I read discussed how a local government municipality in Turkey benefited from migrating away from licensed software towards open source.
The municipality made major changes to their infrastructure, including seemingly basic things like switching from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice to much more daunting tasks including transitioning to open source alternatives for email and database servers.
The goal of this transition was to reduce costs as well as external dependencies, but these benefits could not be instantly realized, planning, testing, and training had to be done prior to every single change.
The rest of the article focused upon these steps that had to be taken to ensure a smooth transition, and the article ends with encouraging others to consider switching to open source in their own environments due to the flexibility, independence, and savings this municipality realized through their transition.

I found this article to be quite interesting, especially as I myself highly value using and promoting open source software whenever possible, and I agree that there is a huge potential for cost saving and flexibility for any organization that has the opportunity to switch to open source.

# Container Concepts

The second article I read gave a bit of an overview of containerization and why it has become so important in the last few years as well as the relationship between containerization, virtualization, and orchestration.

I won't spend too many words reflecting on this article as I had hoped it would put more focus on the open source community and efforts behind container and orchestration software like Docker and Kubernetes, but it was an interesting article regardless as I use have used Docker in the past and I see a lot of potential in the microservices architecture that containerization both utilizes and promotes.
