## Reflections

As I have discussed in previous posts on software engineering practice and failures, software projects often go awry, and the book The Mythical Man Month, written by none other than Fred Brooks, poses several interesting discussions regarding how software engineering teams should be structured and how projects should be managed. In this post I will discuss the concepts Brooks’ poses in the first 4 chapters of the book, including the namesake, the Mythical Man Month.

Brooks begins the book by establishing the woes of software engineering that make the practice such a formidable challenge. He accomplishes this by contrasting the perfection that a working software system requires and the barriers which impede it. For example, he poses that while perfect software requires testing, perfect testing is often impossible or infeasible due to the complexity of a system, time constraints, and the unavoidable fallibility of human beings. Many of the sentiments found here are not new to this blog, as a pervious post discussed another of Brooks’ writings from this book, but it is evident they will be especially relevant here when analyzing the structures of software projects and management.

Next, the issue of project scheduling is discussed and the concept of the Mythical Man Month is introduced. Brooks offers several factors which seem to cause scheduling issues and disasters, including the simple explanation that we are simply bad at estimating how long a project needs, and that the ‘natural’ response to schedule slippage, adding more people to the project, only makes matters worse. It’s here that Brooks begins analyzing the idea of the so called man month, and the interchangeability, or lack thereof, of time and manpower as it applies to software projects. He argues that due to the difficulty of subdividing software projects into distinct components that can be completed individually and without intercommunication, adding manpower to a project when it begins to slip can often make matters significantly worse. As Brooks discusses in the book, this is certainly an issue that developers are quite knowledgeable about, to the point it is common sense that smaller teams or individuals can be significantly faster and more efficient than larger teams, but as the scale of projects is ever increasing, large teams become more and more unavoidable, and thus the mythical man month and the struggles of project scheduling must continue to be examined.

After establishing the complexities of the mythical man month, Brooks goes on to discuss techniques in project design and team structure that can increase the efficiency of a project. First he examines a team structure proposed by Harlan Mills which models a software engineering team on a surgical team. Mills’ proposal emphasizes the importance of specialization to the extreme, and uses each of the roles in the operating room to define corresponding roles on a software engineering team. Finally Brooks discusses the software project from the perspective of project management, and how to maintain conceptual integrity with two differing models, an aristocratic design and a democratic design. These models weigh the importance of having one unified vision from project managers against the value of having the implementers contribute to project design and the challenges both of these scenarios introduce. Both of these discussions are clearly relevant to the success or failure of software engineering projects, and valuable to consider when designing projects and delegating work.

To conclude, from the myth of the man month to the structure of software engineering teams, it is clear that Brooks raises a myriad of valuable and important discussions in his book that everyone involved in a software project should be well aware of.
