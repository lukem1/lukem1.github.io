**The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.**

Software reuse certainly raises several issues relating to intellectual property rights, but I feel that many of these issues can be relatively easily addressed through software development and licensing contracts. For instance, if a contractor is hired to develop a system for a client, a preemptively agreed upon software license should clearly define both the rights of the client and that of the contractor to the software.

There are many different ways a contractor may want to license their software, for example a contractor may wish to control how others can use, modify, or redistribute their software. An interesting example of this today is Epic's Unreal Engine EULA for Publishing. This EULA describes how a developer who makes use of the engine or develops plugins for the engine may distribute their software, and how they must pay royalties based on the sales of software developed using the engine. There are also many prominent open source licenses including the MIT License, Apache License, and GNU General Public License which are commonly used to license open source projects. The GNU GPL for instance goes as far as to require that any derivatives of software under the license must also be licensed with GPL. This ensures that all projects deriving from GPL licensed work must also be open sourced.

Clearly there are countless different ways a software developer may want to publish their work, and it is clear that they should clearly define their software license before doing so. Especially when working as a contractor selling reusable software to a client.
