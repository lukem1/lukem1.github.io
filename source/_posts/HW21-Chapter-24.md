**Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?**

Program inspections involve a line by line peer review of a program where a checklist of common errors is used to look for bugs. Program inspections are often excellent at identifying simpler issues earlier on in the development process, but often miss more complex errors that result from how different systems interact once the components of the project are put together.

**Briefly explain what happens during the software quality review process and the software quality inspection process.**

A typical review process consists of three phases: pre-review activities, the review itself, and post-review activities. The pre-review phase includes things like assembling the review team, preparing documentation, and scheduling. Next, the review phase is where the software is considered and commented upon. Finally, the post-review phase involves addressing any issues raised during the review, for example fixing bugs or brining documentation/style up to standard.

Software quality inspections typically involve peer review of a program by another team member. A line by line review of the source code is completed to search for defects which are then recorded and marked for repair.
