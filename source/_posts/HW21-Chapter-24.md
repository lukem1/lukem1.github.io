**Briefly explain what happens during the software quality review process and the software quality inspection process.**

A typical review process consists of three phases: pre-review activities, the review itself, and post-review activities. The pre-review phase includes things like assembling the review team, preparing documentation, and scheduling. Next, the review phase is where the software is considered and commented upon. Finally, the post-review phase involves addressing any issues raised during the review, for example fixing bugs or brining documentation/style up to standard.

Software quality inspections typically involve peer review of a program by another team member. A line by line review of the source code is completed to search for defects which are then recorded and marked for repair.
