## 4.5

**Using the technique suggested here, where natural language descriptions are presented in a standard format, write plausible user requirements for the following functions:**

**An unattended petrol (gas) pump system that includes a credit card reader.**

**The customer swipes the card through the reader, then specifies the amount of fuel required.**

**The fuel is delivered and the customerâ€™s account debited.**

1. The system shall accept payments from customers via a credit card reader.

2. The system shall allow a customer to pump gas once a credit card is swiped and an amount of gas is entered.

3. The system shall automatically calculate the price of a purchase.

4. The system shall automatically charge a customer for a purchase.

**The cash-dispensing function in a bank ATM.**

1. The system shall allow users to enter their account information or swipe their bank card.

2. The system shall allow users to request up to $1000 cash from their account given they have the appropriate balance.

3. The system will withdraw the requested funds from the users account.

4. The system will dispense the correct amount of cash to the user.

**In an Internet banking system, a facility that allows customers to transfer funds from one account held with the bank to another account with the same bank.**

1. The system shall securely provide access to their bank accounts via a website.

2. The system shall authenticate users using their bank ID and a password.

3. The system shall allow users to perform transfers between accounts in our bank.

## 4.6

 **Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements specification might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.**

As non-functional requirements are often relate to emergent properties of a system, identify which functional requirements relate to these properties and highlight these relationships in the software requirement documentation.

## 4.7

**Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.**

1. A user needs to withdraw money from a bank account.

2. A user needs to convert credit into cash using a credit card.

3. A user needs to deposit money into a bank account.

## Reflections

The analysis of Tire Pressure Management Systems (TPM Systems) in the paper "Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities of In-Car Wireless Networks" demonstrates the value of specifications by revealing some of the dangers of failing to fully consider specifications.

At their core, TMP Systems seemed to result from positive pushes for increased car safety, but as the paper and SPY Car act demonstrate, failures to properly consider security and privacy in the specs led to quite a debacle.
