## Explaining the Code

Chapter 8 of "Teaching Open Source" (TOS) discusses the importance of good code documentation and practices which can lead to well explained code.

First code commenting is discussed, and this is something that is pretty well emphasized in CofC's CS program, but it is always worth reemphasizing. As you write code it is important to consider how effective your comments will be at conveying the purpose and intricacies of your code to someone else or even yourself in the future.

Additionally, in my own experiences reading the code of others, be it a small project or a large library, the quality of the documentation is often of immense value to me, and if it is lacking the entire project becomes much more difficult to understand or utilize.

## Release Early and Often (RERO)

Finally, chapter 9 of TOS discusses the principle of release early, release often. Which poses that utilizing quick and frequent releases in a software development cycle allows for a more efficient and responsive feedback loop between developers and users. The RERO principle seeks to allow faster responses to bugs and other issues as well as user feedback. RERO is an important principle in agile programming and I think it is a valuable methodology in software development which is greatly beneficial to large client focused software projects.

This seems to be especially true for large consumer oriented projects like social media platforms, and from my observations it seems that all major software like this (ie YouTube, Twitter, etc) rely heavily upon RERO principles, and take it even further with techniques like AB testing to further stimulate the feedback loop.

## Conclusions

Both of these chapters discusses topics that I feel are highly important to software engineering, especially as agile methodologies have seemed to become more and more prevalent in recent times in the case of RERO. The Zulip project which my team and I have been working on highly values both of these topics as well. Zulip has extensive documentation which has been very useful to us in getting started and Zulip also uses continuous integration and always has its newest iteration open to the public in a similar fashion to RERO principles.
