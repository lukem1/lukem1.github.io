## Explaining the Code

Chapter 8 of "Teaching Open Source" (TOS) discusses the importance of good code documentation and practices which can lead to well explained code.

First code commenting is discussed, and this is something that is pretty well emphasized in CofC's CS program, but it is always worth reemphasizing. As you write code it is important to consider how effective your comments will be at conveying the purpose and intricacies of your code to someone else or even yourself in the future.

## Release Early and Often (RERO)

Finally, chapter 9 of TOS discusses the principle of release early, release often. Which poses that utilizing quick and frequent releases in a software development cycle allows for a more efficient and responsive feedback loop between developers and users. The RERO principle seeks to allow faster responses to bugs and other issues as well as user feedback. RERO is an important principle in agile programming and I think it is a valuable methodology in software development which is greatly beneficial to large client focused software projects.
