## 2.1

**Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed:**

**A system to control antilock braking in a car**

An antilock braking system is both an embedded and critical system which will require interfaces with hardware systems and extensive safety analysis, so in this case it seems like the Waterfall model would be a pretty good choice.

**A virtual reality system to support software maintenance**

This system would probably be ok with either the Waterfall or Incremental Development approaches. That being said, as VR is still a rapidly developing field, the Incremental Development method might be preferred in order to allow for increased flexibility, a faster launch, and earlier user feedback.

**A university accounting system that replaces an existing system**

A university accounting system is not a particularly unique challenge, and their are probably several generic application systems that can be configured for the university's particular environment and requirements, so the Integration and Configuration model would be a good choice here.

**An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact.**

This system would likely be best suited to the Incremental Development method as it is not a system that will require extremely extensive safety analysis like the anitlock braking system, and this approach would also allow the system to launch faster and get feedback from users earlier on in the development process.
