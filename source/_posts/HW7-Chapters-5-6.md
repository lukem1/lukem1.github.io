## 6.4
**Draw diagrams showing a conceptual view and a process view of the architectures of the following systems:**

**A ticket machine used by passengers at a railway station.**

**A computer-controlled video conferencing system that allows video, audio, and computer data to be visible to several participants at the same time.**
