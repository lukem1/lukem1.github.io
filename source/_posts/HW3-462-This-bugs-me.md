**Create Your Bug Tracker Account**

Zulip uses the GitHub issues feature for bug tracking, so no need to create an account elsewhere, although I have joined their developer chat Zulip server.

**Reproduce a Bug**

The other day while exploring the Zulip project my team and I ran into a lot of issues related to how Zulip handles the deletion/deactivation of stream (similar to channels on Slack).
A bug I was able to reproduce involved users that were part of a stream that has since been deactivated are still able to find the stream in the search functionality and then edit their old messages in the stream.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a stream and comment in it

2. Deactivate the stream

3. Search for the stream using the query "stream:name"

4. Edit an old comment in the deactivated stream
