## Reflections

In this post I will discuss two experiences I have had "Meeting Charleston" and interacting with the computer science community at BSides Charleston and the CofC Alumni Symposium.

First, I wanted to mention BSides Charleston, which describes itself as a "community-driven framework for building events for information security community members". Unfortunately, BSides 2020 was canceled this past year due to COVID-19, but I attended in 2019 and I found that it was an excellent experience and a great way to get involved in the infosec community. The event hosted numerous presentations on topics ranging from research on edge computing automated security cameras to how to structure security teams.

Moving on, I recently attended CofC's CS Alumni Symposium, which I also found to be a valuable experience. Hearing from recent graduates about the paths they have taken and being able to interact with them and ask them about their journeys was very insightful and I felt the Symposium encouraged good discussions between students, faculty, and alumni about the state of the industry and the department.

In conclusion, I felt both of these events were extremely valuable experiences, and that they show how valuable the communities developed around computer science can be.

## The End

This will be the final post in my blog for CSCI 462, so I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that fact and reflect a bit on how this semester has been and how my team and I have progressed through our work on the Zulip project.

Prior to this semester I had not contributed to an open source project before, and I feel that the experience of becoming a contributor to Zulip has been the most valuable thing I have done in this class. Jumping in to an open source project I quite the learning experience, and from learning how to interact with the open source community to working on a popular and large project I have learned quite a lot about the software engineering process and the open source community, and I know my teammates feel similarly.

So this marks the end of my blog, I learned a lot throughout this class and I am looking forward to continuing to develop as a software engineer and contribute to even more open source projects in the future.
