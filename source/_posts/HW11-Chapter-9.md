## 9.8
**Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?**

1. Fault Repairs

Fixing bugs/vulnerabilities by correcting coding errors, design errors, or requirement errors.

2. Environmental Adaptation

Adapting the system to new platforms and environments.

3. Functionality Addition

Adding new features to respond to requirement changes.

Sometimes these types of software maintenance are difficult to distinguish as they are often intertwined. For example, when adding features, new faults may be exposed, etc.

## 9.8 (Global Edition)
**Explain the differences between software reengineering and refactoring**

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code to slow degradation through change, without changing the external behavior.

Software reengineering is the process of restructuring existing software systems to improve structure and understandability.

Reengineering typically takes place after a system has been maintained for a while to improve maintainability, while refactoring is a more continuous process of improvement.

**Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it?**

Absolutely, developing maintainable code is important in any project, and not doing so is irresponsible, especially in cases where the employer does not have knowledge of the software engineering process.
