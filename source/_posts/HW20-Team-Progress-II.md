Since my last post on our project my team has made a lot of progress with our testing framework. We have completed and made significant changes to our runAllTests script, including improvements to error handling and output generation, and we have implemented all 25 of our test cases and their 5 drivers. At this point we have two significant steps left, implementing 5 faults into Moodle for deliverable 5 and bringing everything together in the final report.
