**You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for the services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the companyâ€™s employees, customers, and shareholders.**

This scenario clearly demonstrates unethical behavior. In essence this practice is equivalent to holding the client's businesses hostage for a ransom.

From the perspective of employees/shareholders, this practice may have short term benefits by increasing profits, but I would expect that many clients would see this practice for what it is and, at the very least, seek to replace this system with another option, or even pursue legal action. This would likely lead to long term damage to the company's reputation and client base.
