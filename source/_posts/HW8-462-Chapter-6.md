## Reflections

Chapter 6 of Client Centered Software Development, Database Development, covers the COFOSS approach to designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining databases for use in software projects.
Last semester I took CofC's Database Concepts class, so I found this chapter quite interesting, especially due to its focus upon the practical aspects of integrating databases with software projects, which we only skimmed over in that course.

I found section 6.2, Database Access, to be particularly interesting due to its focus on connecting a program to a database as well as database security.
While in Database Concepts we focused upon designing, normalizing, and manipulating databases this section went a step further and discussed how databases are utilized in a variety of programming languages including Python, PHP, and Ruby.
Additionally, security considerations are extremely important to consider when using databases, as sensitive data can be exposed and/or tampered with if databases are used/configured improperly.
