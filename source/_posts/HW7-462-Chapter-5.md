## Reflections

Chapter 5 of Client Centered Software Development, Domain Class Development, focuses upon the process of developing the domain classes for a CO-FOSS project.
The chapter is broad in scope and covers the first steps of creating or repurposing domain classes to integrating test driven development and refactoring.

I personally found the sections on testing and refactoring to be particularly interesting. The discussion of unit testing was particular relevant to the work I am doing with my team on Zulip, where we have been utilizing test driven development and writing unit tests in our contributions.

Additionally, the section on how to find and utilize other open source code is an important and extremely useful discussion. Sometimes it is easy to fall into the mindset of feeling like you need to build everything from scratch, but software reuse can save huge amounts of time and resources and is what open source software is meant to be used for.

Finally, I feel that refactoring is something we as computer science students do not get the opportunity to do enough. For the most part our projects are one-and-done and never touched again, but in the real world refactoring is an extremely important skill when it comes to software maintenance.

Overall this chapter marks another valuable reading for this course and I feel like it covers a bunch of important topics that are often overlooked in our other courses as I discussed above.
