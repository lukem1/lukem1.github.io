## Reflections

Chapter 5 of Client Centered Software Development, Domain Class Development, focuses upon the process of developing the domain classes for a CO-FOSS project.
The chapter is broad in scope and covers the first steps of creating or repurposing domain classes to integrating test driven development and refactoring.

I personally found the sections on testing and refactoring to be particularly interesting. The discussion of unit testing was particular relevant to the work I am doing with my team on Zulip, where we have been utilizing test driven development in our contributions.
