Hello, I'm Luke.

I'm a Junior Computer Science major and a member of the cofc Cybersecurity club.

This semester my team and I will be contributing to an open source project of our choosing. We are currently investigating options for our project including Envoy Proxy, FreeOTP, and various projects in the Tor Ecosystem.
