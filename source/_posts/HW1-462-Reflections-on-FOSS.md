## Reflections on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)

The development of the FOSS model of software distribution is in my opinion one of the most interesting and most distinguishing features of the field of software engineering. Little rivals the FOSS model in terms of productivity, availability, and openness. In Eric Raymond's essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" he discusses his experience with the FOSS model in his development of a POP email client and relates his experience to his observations of notable FOSS projects including Linux. Raymond analyzes the challenges a FOSS project must overcome and how the style differs from closed source projects, he likens the difference between the two styles to the difference between cathedrals and bazaars, the former being a more "carefully crafted" and "reverent" building while the latter resembles a "babbling" collection of various viewpoints and approaches. I feel that this openness is what makes the FOSS model so special, it allows anyone to make use of or even improve upon a piece of software and brings out the best of the software engineering community.

This all seems particularly relevant as my team and I are picking out a FOSS project to work on this semester and I am looking forward to becoming a part of the FOSS ecosystem that is thriving today.
