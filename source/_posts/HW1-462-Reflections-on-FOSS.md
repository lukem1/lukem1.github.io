## Reflections

The development of the Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) model of software distribution is in my opinion one of the most interesting and most distinguishing features of the field of software engineering. Little rivals the FOSS model in terms of productivity, availability, transparency, and freedom. In Eric Raymond's essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" he discusses his experience with the FOSS model in his development of a POP email client and relates his experience to his observations of notable FOSS projects including Linux. Raymond analyzes the challenges a FOSS project must overcome and how the style differs from closed source projects, he likens the difference between the two styles to the difference between cathedrals and bazaars, the former being a more "carefully crafted" and "reverent" building while the latter resembles a "babbling" collection of various viewpoints and approaches. I feel that this openness is what makes the FOSS model so special, it allows anyone to make use of or even improve upon a piece of software and brings out the best of the software engineering community.

Although I am clearly a proponent of FOSS software, it is also worth considering the difficulties that FOSS may encourage. FOSS projects are not all made equal, and building the community required for a FOSS project to survive is clearly quite difficult. Many open source projects struggle to maintain relevancy and compete with more organized and well funded private counterparts, and even more projects fail to ever reach relevancy at all. But that is not to say the struggles of FOSS are not worth facing. As I previously stated, I feel that FOSS projects contribute massively to the software engineering community and that they help maintain a balance between privatization and freedom.

This all seems particularly relevant as my team and I are picking out a FOSS project to work on this semester and I am looking forward to becoming a part of the FOSS ecosystem that is thriving today.

To conclude this post I thought I would go through all of the software I use on a regular basis and determine how much of it is FOSS. I counted over 20 FOSS projects that I use regularly, notably including Linux (of course), FireFox, WireShark, VirtulBox, Signal, gcc, and the vast majority of the programming languages I have ever used. This just goes to show the value of FOSS and vital it is to software engineering.
