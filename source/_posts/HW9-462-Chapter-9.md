## Reflections

The final chapter of Client Centered Software Development, Continuing the Journey, concludes the discussion of the development of CO-FOSS projects by examining the final steps that should be taken in any project and how to evolve the project into a mature FOSS project through actions including software maintenance, forum development, and establishing a democratic meritocracy to govern the project.

This chapter provided me with a new perspective of many of the FOSS projects I use regularly from LibreOffice to VirtualBox and even Linux. I feel that these final stages of a CO-FOSS project are often undervalued, but as the text describes, are vital to the evolution of a CO-FOSS project into a mature FOSS community.

I feel that the discussions in this chapter underscore the complexities of software engineering and highlight the value of the FOSS model which has provided the world with immeasurably valuable free and democratized projects like Linux. Overall I think it is quite fitting that these reflections will be one of the final blog posts I write for this course, especially after we have had the opportunity to interact and work with FOSS communities throughout this course and see the results of FOSS efforts in the real world.
