**Complex sociotechnical systems lead to three important characteristics. What are they? Explain each in brief.**

1. They have Emergent Properties

When a system is integrated from its components, emergent properties are properties of the system as a whole that do not exist in the individual components.

2. They are Nondeterministic

Given the same inputs, the output is not determined by the system, but the human operator(s), use of the system can create new relationships between system components and therefore change the system's emergent behaviors.

3. They have Subjective Success Criteria
