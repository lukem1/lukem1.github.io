## 19.3
**Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?**

Without knowledge of how the system components will interact, it is pretty clear how it is impossible to predict the exact properties of the complex system, as the interactions between the components are what define the emergent properties of the system.

## 19.3 (Global Edition)
**Complex sociotechnical systems lead to three important characteristics. What are they? Explain each in brief.**

1. They have Emergent Properties

When a system is integrated from its components, emergent properties are properties of the system as a whole that do not exist in the individual components.

2. They are Nondeterministic

Given the same inputs, the output is not determined by the system, but the human operator(s), use of the system can create new relationships between system components and therefore change the system's emergent behaviors.

3. They have Subjective Success Criteria

The 'success' of a system is only not dependent upon the system itself, but external factors including the relationships between organizational objectives, and how people interpret the objectives.
